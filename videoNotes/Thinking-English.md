# The Truth About "Thinking in English": Why It’s Hard and Why Beginners Should Wait

Hi, welcome back to yet another installment on *Ella Teaches English*.

Today I want to talk about the topic of **thinking in English** (or how to build an English mindset). First, I’d like to define what it actually is and what it means to think in English. Then, I want to dissect why people are putting this goal on such a pedestal, what it is they're exactly after, and why I think it's such a buzzword being thrown around.

I also want to explain why a lot of the messages out there, and a lot of the strategies out there, are at best ineffective and at worst completely BS.

### Buckle Up: What Does It Actually Mean?
So, buckle it up. What does it mean to think in English? Why is it so difficult? Why is it such a big goal on many language learners' journeys?

Thinking in English, believe it or not, is harder than you imagined. It essentially is a very immediate, fast, and on-the-spot way of **outputting** English. You're constantly coming up with sentences or combinations of words on the go. You might not say it out loud, you might not repeat it to yourself, it might not even be conscious, but you are essentially writing these sentences down in a really, really immediate way in your brain.

So when you look at it objectively, **it is a form of output.**

When you're a beginner and you don't have enough input, that is, in my opinion, not on your plate right now. You should not be thinking of *"How do I think in English?"* when you haven't developed a habit of consistently reading materials or consistently watching materials. You might not even have a solid base of vocab, let alone sentences. So what to speak of outputting ideas, be it on paper or just silently in your brain?

### The "Buzzword" Trap
Now that we've defined what it means to think in English, now I want to dissect why it's such a big goal, such a buzzword amongst the language learning community, and why I think it's overrated especially for language beginners.

A lot of people assume that as long as you can think in English, your spoken English will be naturally fluent. Like it's not going to be as effortful; it's going to be a smooth sailing experience. And in some way, it is true. In some way, we need to eliminate the translating process. We need to swap out Chinese (or your native language) for a simpler version of English.

But you got to realize: **a lot of people don't study English *in* English.**

They don't read enough English materials—let's start there. They don't watch enough American TV shows. They don't read quality stuff. Or the stuff they read is too difficult. And when people *do* get their hands on a quality material—be it a podcast script or a TV script or something that's really spoken-English centric and appropriate and common—they study every single word, every single concept **in Chinese.**

My question to you is: **How can you think in English when you don't understand things in English?**

### Why "Forcing It" Doesn't Work
This is why advice like *"Oh, set your phone in English,"* or *"Put everything that has Chinese on it away,"* or *"Force yourself to think in English"* doesn't really work.

Because when you interact with the word, when you come into contact with the new word, you're still kind of using Chinese translation to understand it. You have not developed a habit of using a **monolingual dictionary** to understand an abstract word, especially. You have not developed a habit of using a picture dictionary to understand concrete, real-life words—words that you can touch, words that have a picture behind it.

You're still understanding new words, understanding new concepts through translation, and sometimes bad translation.

The way to work around it is by slowly getting used to monolingual dictionaries. When you start out, you can use advanced Chinese-English dictionaries—dictionaries that have Chinese translations, yes, but there are also English definitions and, most importantly, phrases and sample sentences so that you can understand every word in its context. You can even know that there are different ways of using this word—drastically different ways from Chinese—to use this word.

### Recap: The Formula for Thinking in English
So let's recap. To think in English, you must be able to write sentences in English or think sentences in English, having learned new words and new concepts *in English*.

It is a result of consistent and intentional **output practices**: namely writing, repeating to yourself. Which most people shouldn't worry about because they haven't read enough, they haven't done enough input, and they haven't had quality input for an extended period of time. So it's not even what they should be worried about.

For certain concepts, certain words individually, you already think in English. But I think most people want to think in paragraphs; they want to think in sentences; they want to have something in their head when they're listening to people talk. Which is not as easy as just "practicing your way" to think in English. It essentially is practicing your spoken English. It essentially is practicing how to speak.

And it all boils down to:
1.  How much input do you have?
2.  How good are these input materials?
3.  How often do you practice writing?
4.  How often do you check your writing?
5.  How often do you examine if you used this word properly or this sentence structure properly?
6.  Do you speak to yourself?
7.  Do you repeat something to yourself?
8.  Do you even listen to or read enough materials to inspire thoughts in your head?

### The Strategy for Beginners vs. Intermediate Learners

**For Beginners:**
All in all, if you're still a beginner in English and you haven't had consistent input, you haven't developed a streak of learning like maybe a thousand words a day (or when I say learn I don't mean memorize—don't get me wrong—I just mean reading these words and making sure you understand what these words mean in this context, be it a TV show or a book chapter) and then you move on... **don't even worry about output.**

Don't get thrown off by these buzzwords. Just stick to your path. When you get good at inputs, your output will naturally increase.

**For Those With Input Who Still Can't Output:**
If you happen to fall under the umbrella of people who have (or at least they *think* they have) enough input but still can't think of something in English, still can't speak or write, then I would like to invite you to study some of the words you think you know—but this time **in English**.

Try to examine if you truly mastered these words. Which entails:
*   Can you understand the different meanings of this word, or do you just know one?
*   Can you write sentences using this word, but in different ways?

If you can't do that even with reading the dictionary, then of course—just because you know this word doesn't mean you've mastered it. Then your output will reflect that.

Sometimes a lot of people get too aggressive in the beginning. They want to read materials that are beyond their level, materials that have the vocab range beyond 3,000 (which is not even common or practical in everyday life). So as a result, yes, you can read a lot of jargony stuff, a lot of terminologies, but you might have not mastered the words that are really common but all the more difficult and versatile because they have so many different meanings.

### Final Advice: The First 6 Months
So yeah, in the first 6 months, don't even worry about output. Don't even worry about thinking or writing English. Don't even worry about speaking.

Just focus on your basics. Focus on the basics of your pronunciation, the basics of your grammar. Start with an easy material that you can handle. Focus on input—getting enough input, that's also *quality* input. Make sure that you master (or do the best you can to master) these common 3,000 words, and then you'll be golden.

You don't even have to "think in English" as long as you can understand things in English without the help of a dictionary. Just like any material you come upon or any conversation that you happen to eavesdrop on—if you can understand things without any limitations, at which point **you're already thinking in English.**

If you've always struggled with pronunciation or grammar or just the strategy side of things—you don't know where to start, what books to buy, what tools to use, how to even come up with the routine—then sign up for my course. You won't regret it. Even if you regret it, you get seven days of no-questions-asked, no-reasons refund back to you. Sometimes I even extend that policy, so I have so much confidence in my course. I've benefited from this methodology, this strategy a long time ago, so I'm practicing what I preach.

So yeah, you're in for a good one.

All right, bye.

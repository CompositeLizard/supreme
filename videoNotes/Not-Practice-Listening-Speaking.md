# Why I Don’t Practice Listening or Speaking (And What I Do Instead)

Hey guys, my name is Ella and you're watching *Ella Teaches English*.

Today I want to talk about why I don't practice listening or speaking—be it for English or recently French.

The reason is quite simple actually: **you can't singularly, single-handedly improve just speaking or just listening.**

## The "Spot Reduction" Myth
Just like you can't spot reduce fat, many personal trainers will tell you: you're not just fat in your thighs, you're not just fat in your belly, you're fat kind of all throughout. Of course, we all have different body types; we store more fat in certain areas than others, but you still have this amount of body fat. And the reason you have excess fat anywhere is because you don't practice calorie deficit—you're eating more than you're consuming, you're providing your body with more energy than it consumes and expends.

And when you lose weight, you lose weight all throughout. Certainly, you can lift weights and build special muscle groups; that way when you lose fat, the muscles underneath will show up more. But you still lose weight, you still lose fat rather evenly all throughout.

## The Three Elements of Language
Similarly, you can't single out listening or speaking when learning English because there's more than what meets the eye.

Whether it's speaking, listening, reading, or writing, they all have something to do with:
1.  **The basics of your grammar**
2.  **The basics of your pronunciation**
3.  **How many words you know and how well you know these words**

## The Problem with "Just Listening"
Take listening for instance. A lot of people put on a podcast, they put on a listening material, they don't care about the vocab, they don't even read the script, and a lot of times their own pronunciation is wanting.

And so how do you expect to pick up on words that you've never even looked up in a dictionary? That on paper, you still don't understand?

## The Problem with "Just Speaking"
Take speaking for another instance. A lot of people practice speaking by essentially reciting other people's speeches—be it a TED Talk or a TV script or some call it "shadowing" (which is just immediate reciting of other people's work).

You're still not thinking of what words to say. You're not coming up with something to say yourself. A lot of times you don't even fully understand what other people are talking about when you recite their speeches. You haven't looked up their individual words, be it the pronunciation of these words or the actual meanings and how you should use these words.

## Focus on Pronunciation for Comprehension
When I say I don't practice speaking, I don't mean I don't practice pronunciation. Heck, in the beginning, I focused a lot on my pronunciation. I went to lengths to perfect my connected speech—not because I want to sound like an American, like a native speaker, but **because I want to understand through listening.** I want to be able to pick up on certain speech patterns so that I can understand things quicker.

So it's more for **comprehension**, not for my own expression.

When you do that, you can dissect what exactly is lacking. What element in your language proficiency is lacking?
*   Is it your grammar skills? What exact rule do you not understand?
*   What exact word do you not understand? Do you need to look up this word in a dictionary?
*   Are you struggling with the basics of pronunciation? Is that why you can't understand something that you could theoretically understand on paper?

So you could be really scientific and surgical about this.

## Re-Categorizing the Four Skills
Another benefit of breaking the language into these three elements (Pronunciation, Grammar, Vocab) instead of Listening, Reading, Writing, Speaking is that after you're done with pronunciation and grammar—which shouldn't take that long, there are only so many symbols, only so many grammar rules—you can categorize the rest as **Input** and **Output**.

**Input: Reading vs. Listening**
Listening is just a faster input. There's no script, there's no text to remind you what this word is. You need to have learned these words and their pronunciation ahead of time to be able to pick up on them in listening.

I would then argue that most people don't struggle with listening; **most people struggle with reading.** They cannot even understand these words or sentences when they're in a written format. Or they could, but it's too slow. Because in listening, when a sentence is too complex, you don't have the luxury of going back to the beginning of the sentence and kind of dissecting and guessing in your head what the sentence could mean. It needs to be immediate.

So if your basics and grammar are not solid, you will of course not understand. But that's not your listening's problem. You don't need to practice more listening. In fact, if you practice more on listening, you're just wasting time because you're not getting to the root of the problem. You need to focus on your grammar basics.

**Output: Writing vs. Speaking**
Similarly, when it comes to output, **most people don't struggle with spoken English; they struggle with writing.** They struggle with slowly writing things down.

If you can't write down as many sentences as you can on the go without any preparation, without any hints, without reading any materials, then how can you expect yourself to come up with sentences through speech on the go? Especially in a conversation. Most people think of spoken English not as a monologue but as a conversation.

So not only are you thinking of things to say on the spot, you're also contemplating what the other person just said. You're doing two things at once: you're dissecting and understanding input, and you're coming up with things to say (output).

When you can't even write things down slowly (writing is a slow output), how can you expect yourself to do the faster version of output, which is speaking?

### The Solution: Examine Your Weaknesses
You need to examine what exactly is lacking. Is it your vocab? Is it your grammar? Is it your pronunciation? (Like it doesn't need to be perfect, but if your vowel for instance is way off, most native speakers don't understand; they will probably ask you what exact word do you mean, or in a group discussion they'll just pretend that they don't hear you or they'll move on to someone else).

What most people are doing with practicing listening and speaking is not conducive to their language growth. It's not conducive to their fluency. And in fact, is quite often a waste of time. You need to have a good hard look at yourself, examine which element—be it pronunciation, grammar, or vocabulary—is lacking and just focus on that.

And then you don't have to focus on listening or speaking. Just dissect or group your learning into two major directions: **Input** or **Output**.

### Don't Neglect Writing
And when it comes to output, let's not neglect writing anymore, okay? Because essentially when you're speaking, you're just writing things in your head immediately on the go without any preparation. That's obviously too advanced for beginners.

I couldn't do that, but you know what I could do? What I did was writing sentences down, writing diaries, copying other people's sentences, copying sample sentences in a dictionary. Even when it's not original at all, the fact that you're thinking of these words, the fact that you're slowing your brain down and processing how these words string together is setting a foundation for when you need to come up with sentences for yourself when you speak or when you write.

***

So there you go. That is why I don't practice speaking or listening individually. I don't even think of English in those four skills. I think of Input and Output, and then I think of three elements: Pronunciation, Grammar, and Vocab.

I'm still getting more vocab, I'm still reading, I'm still trying to build a bigger vocab. I'm trying to read more and write more, debate with people more, have discussions with people more, pick up on words, write things down, write words down, study words in a dictionary... but I don't "practice spoken English." Even though those things would result in me speaking or a lot of times writing better. (You don't see what I write because I don't publish them, but some of the videos I made I had to write the script beforehand). Yeah, it's all related is what I'm trying to say.

All right, I hope this helps. I don't know why it came to me, I just felt inspired. I think this principle applies to any language. Think of Chinese—like have you ever sat in a "Spoken Chinese" class or a "Listening Chinese" class? You just read more.

Obviously, as a Chinese native, you don't think of pronunciation or grammar because you've already mastered them. So when it comes to speaking, why do some people speak more fluently and eloquently and more articulately? Why do some people even when they speak Chinese their whole life sound really basic for lack of a better term? Like I sound really basic in Chinese. Well, duh—I haven't read a Chinese book front to back, cover to cover, extensively looking every word up in the dictionary. So obviously my input is lacking, and my output is lacking even more.

So there you go. Reverse engineer that and apply it to your English learning journey. Stop messing around with these fake gurus giving out fake speaking strategies and listening strategies. Especially when they're native English speakers that don't speak any other languages. Use your common sense, okay?

Bye.

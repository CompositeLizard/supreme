# The Power of Accountability: Why I Started French Classes and Hiring Coaches

Greetings, my dear.

As you can see, I've undergone quite a few changes. First of all, my hair is short—or at least shorter. I tried. I did give long hair a good college try, but yeah, it just wasn't for me. I have really chunky and thick hair, so when it gets long, it just gets overwhelmingly hot. Plus, I like to work out, so whenever I work out I have to come home and take a full two-hour long shower, and that's just not sustainable for anyone.

So, get used to this.

## Putting Myself in the Student's Shoes

So recently I started taking French classes—like 101 online classes—both because I want to study French (it's been on my bucket list forever) and also because I want to put myself in the shoes of a non-native English speaker, a non-native English learner.

It's been a while since I've actually actively studied a language; I've just been using the language to learn stuff. So it's hard for me to contextualize what that experience is like, or I guess it's hard for me to remember since it's been almost 10 years since I started. I figured taking French and learning a new language will help me anticipate and understand the difficulties that a new language learner will encounter.

Prior to taking one-on-one classes, I was kind of dabbling. You know, I would download apps, I would buy textbooks (which by the way are horrible), so I was kind of learning French on my own for a long time. And it never really got anywhere because, well, I didn't know how well I was doing and there was no accountability.

When you're busy and preoccupied with everything else, it's hard to know what to study every day, let alone be focused. And even if you have the mental capacity to pick something to study every day, it probably isn't the thing that you should be focusing on. So here comes the power of accountability: the power of having a teacher, the power of having someone to just keep track of your progress, someone to tell you what to do every day. Especially when you're so busy with your life in general, it's such a relief to not have to think about that.

## The Workout Analogy

Besides French, I am also going to this workout class. It's kind of a semi-private workout; it's almost like a private coaching session. But if you think about it, all the workout regimens, all the exercises are available out there on the internet. It's not revolutionary, it's nothing brand new. You're just doing the same thing over and over again. A lot of times, you're doing a *boring* thing over and over again.

But having a partner, or I guess having a teacher or trainer to look at you and just to monitor you—and sometimes even cheer you up—is so underrated. Maybe it's because I have poor discipline, or sometimes I just don't know what exercises to do on a daily basis, but it's easy for me to just fall off that wagon.

For me at least, on the other hand, I have this friend (or I guess accountability partner). We meet every week and we talk about what's been going on. But that's just another point.

## The Psychology of Disappointing People

The point is, you can pay someone to hold you accountable, or you can trade your time or your expertise with someone else's time and expertise. That way, if you're gonna fall off the wagon, if you're gonna lose your momentum, you're actively disappointing people. It's not just an app or a machine that you're answering to; you're actively disappointing people.

We humans are naturally embarrassed by—or I guess guilty of—disappointing people, especially people that have put a lot of effort into us. If you haven't exercised in the last week or so and your personal trainer is just there waiting for you to come back, you're gonna feel bad. Even if you fall off the wagon for a little bit, you'll naturally pick up the pace really quick.

Our default is to be lazy. Our default is to not want to think and not want to show up. And so I think at least in the beginning, when you're not good at something, when you don't know what materials to study or what exercise programs to follow, find someone that's relatively trustworthy.

## Why You Should Hire an Expert

In my case, because I'm an English teacher, in addition to teaching stuff to my students, I also assign a lot of homework to my students. I let them know what they're doing is working, what they're doing is not working, and what they should be focusing on. All of this strategy brainstorming session they probably *can* also just do it on their own, but it's much easier to let someone else do it for them—and let someone else with actual experience do it for them.

If you have the means to it, financial or else, why not just pick the easiest thing? Why not work with someone who knows what they're doing?

It saves you time, and all the time that you're saving could earn you much more money. Or, you know, you could just spend time with your family; that's time better spent than wasting your time doing a bunch of things that may or may not work.

Even if you're trying to save money in the long run: let's say you wanted to save money in the beginning at least when you don't know your stuff—have someone train you. Have someone teach you the ways. Actively ask them: *"How in the future would I be able to do this on my own? How do I come up with a workout plan? How do I get rid of you as soon as possible?"*

I would tell my students that, and I would ask my personal trainers that—like what kind of food to eat, what kind of workout schedule should I abide by so that I won't have to rely on them forever. I mean, that's the goal. There comes a point when a teacher or a mentor will actually hold you back, but that's not your priority right now. Your priority right now is to admit that you don't know your stuff and just learn from people or have people hold you accountable.

Yeah, this is my biggest epiphany lately and it's actually saved me a lot of time, a lot of energy, and by extension a lot of money.

Do with this information what you will.

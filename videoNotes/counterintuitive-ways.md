# Counter-Intuitive Strategies for Learning a Brand New Language

So now that I'm a complete beginner in a brand new language yet again, I had to remind myself of the same strategies that I used, and I thought I'd share them with you today.

## 1. Don't Worry About Speaking (Focus on Input)
Number one, I don't worry about speaking—at least in the beginning—or rather, any form of self-expression.

There's very little output when you're learning a brand new language. All you should be focusing on is **input comprehension**: namely understanding what the native speaker is trying to say or understanding what this article is trying to say. Even if you force yourself to memorize a bunch of phrases or you memorize a dialogue that you see in a textbook, there's no predicting what the native speaker would say to you. You can't predict the range of vocabulary that the native speaker will have.

During my very first five or even six months, I kept my mouth shut. I read lots of books. I would scour through the subtitles religiously. Make sure you build your vocabulary. Make sure you understand the basics of a sentence, the basics of grammar.

Even if at any given moment someone speaks 10 sentences to you and you just utter one single word, as long as you can understand what the other person is saying, you'll be fine. Comprehension is so underrated. Once you've accumulated a certain amount of input—quality input, mind you—speaking comes naturally. You don't have to force it. You *can't* force it. And anybody that tells you otherwise is lying to you.

## 2. Don't Focus on "Real Life" Words
Number two, I don't focus on "real life" words. That includes numbers, days of the week, months, and how to tell time. Anything with a picture attached to it—like a girl, a book, a computer, a desk—I never force myself to even spend time on it. Let it go. Don't memorize it.

There's no point in trying to memorize real-life words because you could just use Google Translate or Google Images. You can even go to a bookstore and buy one of those photo dictionary books when in need. Every time you go into a new environment, say someone else's living room, then you can look up words that will often come up in a living room.

On the contrary, it's **abstract words**—that are hard to translate, that you can't look up quickly in the dictionary or in Google Translate—that are very versatile, useful, but complex and definitely require extra hours of study.

So I've always prioritized learning verbs, adjectives, adverbs, conjunctions... just any words I can use myself and use in any scenario. Besides, words like months or days of the week and numbers will come up often enough if you use the language, if you actually pronounce things. If you can pronounce things, you can usually spell it out. But there's no point in studying *only* those words and knowing how to name a picture or name a subject. That's not speaking the language; that's just knowing how to name objects.

A lot of people end up knowing how to say one to ten in English, or saying "mother" and "father," "girl" or "boy," but they can't speak a whole sentence because they don't have enough understanding of abstract words and even basic grammar structure. So yeah, use your time wisely.

## 3. Use a Monolingual Dictionary
Number three, I use a monolingual dictionary, especially for abstract words like we talked about before.

I know not everybody can do it, especially in the beginning, but the point is you should strive for it. You should at least try to transition into using a monolingual dictionary. If you find a good one (which I haven't at least in French, but in English I swear by this monolingual dictionary), the definition is often very easy to understand. You can sometimes understand the word better—well, most of the time understand the word better—in English than if you were to understand it in Chinese (or your native language).

Languages are so different. Most of the time, especially for abstract words, there's no word-for-word translation. It's not accurate. If you always use Chinese translation, then every time you speak you have to translate that word into English. Every time you try to understand other people, you have to translate English into your native language. And that is a waste of time. It takes up so much of your mental space, and in speaking, everything happens fast.

So do your best to transition into a monolingual dictionary. But even if you don't use a monolingual dictionary, try your best to incorporate some phrases or examples so that the next time you want to use this word, you're not thinking of the translation. You're not thinking of your native language; you're thinking of a phrase.

The point is you gotta **cut out the middleman**, because the middleman slows you down and the middleman is not accurate. Ideally, your two languages should be parallel in your brain; they should not intersect. You could totally understand an English word without using Chinese, so you can try to understand a harder word using simple English.

## 4. Focus on Context (And "Squeeze" the Material)
Number four, I focus on something with context first. Instead of learning individual words on a word list, I usually prefer a TV show or an article or a book—anything with sentences right next to each other where there's a chance for me to run into the same word over and over again.

Once I find a good language material, I focus in on the material one at a time. People spend so little time reading these days, and when they do find a good material, they just gloss over everything. They can't wait to get to the next lesson, they can't wait to get to the next chapter. It's like, *no*. Especially when you're a non-native speaker, you gotta squeeze out every piece of good information from the same material.

I've been working on this TED Talk in French and I use it to practice my pronunciation, I use it to learn some of the common expressions, spoken expressions, or very formal written expressions. And it's been like weeks, if not months, since I started and I still find new information. I still find something I haven't noticed before.

I'm not afraid to spend more time than needed on a piece of material because I know the benefits are totally worth it. Like, I'm at a point where I can almost memorize the whole speech. When I recite the speech out loud, it's like *I'm* giving a speech in French.

So don't be afraid to first of all spend time finding a good material that has the proper range of vocab, the proper amount of difficulty in terms of grammar, in terms of pronunciation. Once you find a good material, dedicate yourself to it.

And on that note on finding the proper material for you: If for instance you always watch American TV shows and you have friends from America, don't then read Jane Austen and then wonder, *"How come I can't understand a run-of-the-mill American dude?"* It's because he's not an 18th-century English author. Languages evolve over time. Read something contemporary. Read something like preferably non-fiction first because you don't use most of the words that you would encounter in fiction. Be very picky about what you read. (I gotta make a video on like beginner-friendly books or beginner-friendly language materials).

***

So that is it. I guess some of these are not really counter-intuitive; they're just common sense, but I feel like bringing it up.

Do let me know if you're learning a language via English or French, or if you're also learning French. Hype each other up. This is me hyping you up.

Okay, all right. Bye.

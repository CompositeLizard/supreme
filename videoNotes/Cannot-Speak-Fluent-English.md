# Why You Can't Speak Fluent English (Even With a High Test Score)

I like to take this opportunity to touch on some of the questions I hear over and over again in my sessions. I figured even if you can't afford to take lessons with me or if you don't have the time to take lessons with me, this will still benefit just about everyone. It doesn't matter what level you're at.

So without further ado, let's get right into it.

**Question number one:** *"I have a really high score or I have a really big vocabulary, but somehow my spoken English is still not the most ideal. It's not fluid enough, it's not accurate enough a lot of times, and sometimes I can't even come up with things to say."*

A lot of people seem to have created this false dichotomy between **textbook English** and **actual authentic English**—and more specifically, in the form of communicating, coming up with ideas, and actually coming up with things to say right in that moment.

I like to take a different approach and kind of demolish this dichotomy.

### The Piano Analogy: Why Tests Don't Equal Fluency
My belief—or I guess my theory—is that a lot of times it's not that people are good at one thing and bad at another. It's that exams are not indicative of your real English level because there are many different techniques involved. Lots of times people don't really spend the required amount of time to actually get to that level.

For instance, I myself grew up playing the piano. If you're Chinese, you know that every summer or every year there's a test or competition that you attend to get that level. I got to almost the top—I got level eight. But it doesn't indicate that my piano skills are actually at that level.

If you were to give me a new music score and just ask me to sight-read—even if it's a lower level than level eight—because I had always only practiced for only four pieces in that one year, all my basics, all my foundation was still lacking.

It doesn't matter how much vocab you think you have, how much you scored in a certain test (even if it's IELTS or TOEFL, a very comprehensive test already). It still is not the most foolproof, airtight indication of where you're currently at. It's even less accurate if you use a lot of exam techniques.

I have a lot of students coming to me who are either working or studying in America or any other foreign country. A lot of times they have over 10,000 or 9,000 vocab words, and they still somehow can't speak.

## The Problem with Abstract Vocabulary
The first response I always tell them is that you don't actually know these words. Like, you *think* you know that many words, but you have a rough idea. You know the most basic Chinese translation of these words, especially when it comes to abstract words.

There are two major categories of all the vocab:
1.  **Concrete words:** Things you can physically see or touch.
2.  **Abstract words:** Basically all the verbs and adjectives—things that you can't touch, things that you can't physically see. It's more like an action, a verb, a feeling, a certain abstract concept.

These abstract words are actually really versatile, and at the same time very practical and useful. But the downside of only studying these words with Chinese translation and very few definitions is that you don't see the full scope of all the definitions.

Not to mention, you rarely ever see them in context because you spend so much time memorizing vocab lists. So there's no way for you to actually know how to use this word if you don't use a dictionary—an actual dictionary, not just a translation app—to think of them in terms of phrases.

So, the quality of your vocab, especially when it comes to abstract words, is very low.

## Quality Over Quantity
Your regular vocab test doesn't indicate the quality of your vocab. When it comes to outputting ideas, especially in terms of writing and speaking, you don't actually need a lot of vocab. You don't need quantity; you need **quality**. You need to actually master your words.

Without massive amounts of input, without careful study of these words in a dictionary (I'm not talking about slang or idioms—things that are kind of out of the norm). I'm speaking purely in terms of words that we've all learned, like *go*, *hang*, *hit*, *get*, *take*. All these words we've learned in middle school or high school at the very least. But without looking them up in a dictionary or studying them with a bona fide native speaker teacher and asking them extensively about how to use each and every single word... you struggle.

A lot of times people would say to me, *"My spoken English is the worst but my listening is okay. Like I can understand roughly what people are talking about."*

But the thing is, if your grasp of these vocab words is so low, you *think* you understand them but you don't. You're just kind of making do with what you think you know, and a lot of times you're guessing. And so when your brain is preoccupied because it's busy guessing what the other person is saying and busy also trying to translate every English word into Chinese, you don't have the mental capacity to think of things that you can say.

### Stop Trying to Run Before You Can Walk
So what I tell people in order to solve this problem is to stop fixating on outputting ideas—and especially outputting ideas in the form of speaking. Because yeah, it's like trying to run before you know how to walk properly.

Instead, try to **study**—not memorize. When I tell people I don't memorize any vocab, people think that I don't prioritize vocabulary. That's totally not the case; it's the opposite. I probably spend more energy on vocab, although I'm not killing myself over here. I'm not struggling, I'm not forcing myself to do anything. It's actually fun when you can really dig deep into these very common, very versatile words.

(Just a side note: *Versatile* or *ver-sa-tile*, whichever way you say this word is correct. It's like *interesting* versus *in-ter-est-ing*.)

Especially if you kind of excel in school or excel in exam English, let that idea go. One of the first things that my dad (my English mentor) told me is that even if you scored like a 100 in a prestigious, very recognized test like IELTS or TOEFL, just consider yourself a passing grade. You have a certain foundation, you have a basic understanding of the grammar, you know how English works, you know the alphabet. That's not nothing. But other than that, just let that go.

You haven't actually read a lot in English. When people watch TV in the name of learning English, they rarely spend time reading the subtitles and singling out words that are probably going to help them in everyday English or looking them up in a dictionary. Rarely do people do that. So when you don't have that consistent input, how can you expect yourself to speak so fluently?

# The Magic of the "Common 3000"
Most importantly, when it comes to input, a lot of people confuse that with *"Okay, now I'm just gonna start listening to BBC and CNN."* There's no discernment when it comes to what materials or what kind of input they should start with.

I'm just going to assume that most people have not even dealt with the most basic, most common **3,000 words** that we encounter in everyday life. They kind of skipped the first step. When you skip a very important step and try to move on to very academic words and very academic language, first of all, it's not going to help you with your everyday communication. And second of all, you're not going to be as productive and you're going to tire yourself very easily, especially when those words are supposed to help you transition to the next step.

They have calculated that if you can get a basic but sufficient grasp of these 3,000 words, that will account for **82% of all your English usage**—be it in the form of writing, speaking, listening, or understanding.

But the key is: you can't just know the most basic (and most of the time not accurate) Chinese translations of these words. So stop memorizing vocabularies. Stop doing that. Go find a language material that has those words, or you could just start looking words up in a list. (I will give you the list; I'll give you the PDF).

Before you know it, first of all, you're gonna start feeling like *"Okay, I actually understand what this native speaker is speaking—like fully 100% understand."* And even if I don't understand a certain word, I can catch them really fast.

## Writing is the Key to Speaking
Provided that your pronunciation and grammar are taken care of (and this is where I come in—pronunciation and grammar is where I thrive; I can pinpoint exactly which problem you're suffering from), once you start digging deeper into the 3,000 words, you won't panic when a native speaker is talking to you. Even if there's a word that you don't know or haven't heard of, you can safely just pick that word out and ask them what that word means.

So rather than trying to speak and output ideas, just accept that your input is already kind of low. Don't try to run before you can walk. But what I can help you with is giving you the confidence. When you have full comprehension of what the other person is speaking, even if you can just say one sentence for every 10 sentences that the other person has said to you, you'll feel much greater.

Before you know it, you'll have so much input that you'll naturally want to have some kind of outflow. And it will start with **writing**.

I don't know why people are not writing. I don't know why they're not as obsessed about writing as they are about speaking. When people talk about output, they really talk about writing things or writing a draft right before you speak (or public speaking, which ultimately is prepared writing and you're just reciting what you've written).

When you think about it, speaking is just a faster version of writing. So when you suck at a slower version of writing (which is just writing itself), how do you expect to be accurate and actually make sense when you speak?

The math is not mathing, my friends.

That's it for today. Hopefully, my hair isn't so messed up.

# The Bill Gates Method: How to Read, Remember, and Master New Topics

### Part 1: How to Remember What You Read

If you read enough, there's a similarity between things that makes it easy, because this thing is like this other thing. If you have a broad framework, then you have a place to put everything.

**The Importance of a Framework**
If you want to learn science, reading the history of scientists and the story of scientists—about when they were confused and what tools or insights allowed them to make the progress they made—gives you the timeline, or the map, or the branches of science. You know what's known and what's not.

So, **incremental knowledge** is so much easier to maintain in a rich way.

At first, it is very daunting. If it's the first time somebody is telling you about Rome, you think, *"Why am I reading about Rome? I'm reading about Queen Victoria."* But then, as you get that kind of scope, all these pieces fit in. So it's fun to say, *"Okay, this is where this belongs,"* and *"Oh, does this contradict something I knew before?"* I better look that up. I better figure it out. It really bothers you when you read things and there's some inconsistency.

**The Chess Analogy**
If you take a chess board and randomly place the pieces and ask a chess person to memorize it, they can't do it. This is because everything about chess positions is about the logic of how things developed. So if you show them a position that's illogical or incorrect, you would never get to their encoding system. It isn't set up to absorb that.

### Part 2: Rules for Reading Books

**Rule #1: Finish What You Start**
I don't let myself start a book that I'm not gonna finish.

You know, when you're reading, you have to be careful that you really are concentrating. Particularly if it's a non-fiction book, are you taking the new knowledge and sort of attaching it to knowledge you have? For me, taking notes helps make sure that I'm really thinking hard about what's in there.

If I disagree with the book, sometimes it takes a long time to read the book because I'm writing so much in the margin. It's actually kind of frustrating. *"Oh, please say something I agree with so I can get through to the end of this book."*

**The "Infinite Jest" Dilemma**
So there's this one, it's a fiction book called *Infinite Jest*. What I'm trying to decide is if I start it or not. Because I watched the movie *The End of the Tour*, and I loved it. David Foster Wallace comes across as a super interesting, broad-thinking person. If the book was like a two or three-hundred-page book, there's no doubt—as soon as I watched that movie, I would dive in. But it's quite long and complicated and, you know, I don't want to make an exception. It's my rule to get to the end.

**Paper vs. Digital**
Over time, I will make the switch, but when I'm just sitting there at night reading, often a paper magazine or the book, I'm used to that. And it's ridiculous because I care. I have a whole book bag that goes on my trips with me and it's voluminous and antiquated.

**Block Out Time**
If you're reading books like these, you'd want to be sitting down for an hour at a time. Because otherwise, just getting your mind around *"Okay, what was I reading?"* is not the kind of thing you can do five minutes here, ten minutes there. Magazine articles fit, or short YouTube videos fit into those little slots.

And so, every night I'm reading a little over an hour, and so I can take my current book and make some progress.

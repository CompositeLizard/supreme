# Why I Never Went to an English Corner (And Why You Shouldn’t Either)

Well, hello, hello, hello.

I wasn't expecting my last video about a literal dictionary to go viral, but here we are. So, as you can see in my very clickbaity title, I almost never went to a native speaker. I never went to an English corner. I think I went once and then I decided: *this isn't it. This just isn't for me.*

First of all, I was too socially awkward. I was too intimidated to talk to a stranger in Chinese, let alone English. And second of all, I just didn't find it helpful. I'll tell you why in a bit.

But that's interesting because when people hear me talk—Chinese people and Americans alike—they just assume that I was either born here, that I was born in America, that I was an ABC (American-Born Chinese), or that I had a native speaker at my house just listening to me talk or talking with me every day. They assume I had this crazy amount of courage, that I was really outgoing and sociable and would jump at any chance to talk to a native speaker.

When in reality, I would rather kind of just work on my own—hone in on the few very technical skills, be it my pronunciation, building a bigger vocab, or rewording how I say things.

## The Argument: Why Conversation Isn't Ideal for Beginners

So what I'm arguing is that for 99% of English learners—beginners and intermediate learners alike—it's not ideal to go to an English corner. It's not ideal to talk to a native speaker in hopes of improving your English.

And before you come at me and be like, *"Get off your high horse, who do you think you are? Native speaker teachers are so much better than you, they have better pronunciation than you do, and you're just jealous,"*—which, you make a fair point—but let's distinguish **learning by talking** from **learning from exposure**.

I'm all for exposure. I'm all for you listening to two native speakers talk, whether in real life, on TV, in a monologue, in a speech, or in a podcast. I'm all for exposure. But those are done in a controlled environment. Even when people talk to each other—like two native speakers talk to each other in real life and you're just eavesdropping—you can learn so much by just observing and listening to what they're saying.

This is different from a native speaker talking *to* you. Because you're like *here* (low level) and he's *here* (high level), and for him to talk to you, he has to come down here to meet you. Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to communicate. And so if you are talking in the beginning when you're a beginner, you might not learn anything because he had to come down to your level.

Whereas if you're listening to two native speakers talk to each other, you can kind of deduce what they are talking about based on the context, even if you run into a word that you don't know. This is even better when there's text or a subtitle to their conversation, which is why I recommend you listen to people talk on TV or in a video with subtitles—with not only the audio but also the text.

So I'm not saying "don't listen to native speakers, only listen to Chinese people." That's not what I said. I'm just saying you don't want one-on-one interaction with them *first*.

## When Are Native Speakers Actually Useful?

There is a time and a place for taking advanced lessons with a native speaker, and I think the best timing is when you've reached a certain level of fluency. When you've reached a basic command—I'll quantify it in a little bit for you—of the language. When you've understood the most common words, how to use them, and how to use them more flexibly and in a more versatile way.

**That's when you go to a native speaker.**

At that stage, it's not "practicing your spoken English." It's just:
*   Learning ideas from them.
*   Learning new vocab from them.
*   Asking them for book recommendations.
*   Going to them with your essay that you've written and asking them to correct your grammar mistakes.
*   Or better yet, when you go abroad to study, you're learning **actual subjects** in English.

That's not learning English; at least you're not *just* learning English. You're learning a subject in a brand new language, and as you're doing it, you're picking up words kind of passively along the way. But your focus is still on that subject. That way you're getting exposure, you're getting real and authentic expressions, and you're seeing how native speakers use things in either everyday life (informal) or in written format (formal).

That's when being around native speakers or learning a different subject in English from a native speaker teacher becomes useful and financially responsible.
### The Financial and Practical Reality

It makes the most financial sense to go to a native speaker *then*. If your vocab is below 3,000, before you practice your liaison, your basic pronunciation, there is no point in either living with a native speaker or going to an English corner.

First of all, you don't understand each other. And second of all, even if you do, the part that they can help you out with is so easy that you might as well go find a Chinese teacher (or a teacher who speaks your native language) that can do just as good a job—if not better—in terms of explaining grammar and explaining what to do step-by-step. A native speaker who has never learned a foreign language, never learned a second language, might not appreciate what it's like to be a beginner in a brand new language.

And then there is the hard part: teaching you new words and new expressions. A lot of native speakers like to teach idioms and slang. That level of difficulty is also problematic because usually, when a native speaker teaches, it's in a mid-sized class. So he or she doesn't know what your current level is at. For them to put so much information on you, first, it might not register. It might not take.

Second of all, you can also learn them on your own by watching TV or by buying decent reference books. Reference books not only give you the same information but are also more organized, more detailed, more extensive, and are always at your beck and call. If you have a good dictionary, if you have a good reference book, if you have a good TV show, you can always just learn new expressions at your own pace.

## The Power of Self-Study

Most of the learning, most of the language acquisition in terms of gaining more vocab and improving the quality of your vocab, is most of the time done on your own.

Take myself for example. I am surrounded by native speakers; I have no shortage of friends to talk to in English. But that's not all I do, right? I read things in English. I read books, articles, news. I watch videos in English. So it's not just me single-handedly carrying a conversation or the other native speaker trying to feed information to me. I also spend a lot of time reading. I have a consistent input of I would say like 500 to a thousand words a day in the last five or six years that I've lived here.

So my overall improvement of my language isn't strictly attributed to just talking to people.

Hopefully, you understand that I'm not reducing this whole phenomenon down to "native speakers bad, Chinese teachers good." It's more nuanced than that.

That is it. I hope you get the point that I'm trying to make. Hopefully, this video doesn't become contentious or controversial, but if so, all the better. No publicity is bad publicity. Am I right? Try saying that a few times.

# How to Conquer and Excel at Small Talk (Especially for Non-Native Speakers)

Well, hello there. Why is it that every time I'm actually doing something else important, some random video idea just pops into my head?

Check out my curved monitor. This thing is a workhorse of a machine. I'm editing right here, checking out my old content right here, designing my courses right here, and I just finished a 101 class which honestly inspired today's content: **how to conquer and excel at small talk.**

So, stay tuned.

### The Two Segments of Small Talk

As a former-slash-current... hold on, let me just close this window because it's kind of cringe having my face looking to the left.

Okay, the way I look at small talk is roughly broken down into two segments:

1.  **The Social Aspect:** This is the kind of stuff that non-native speakers and native speakers alike have to get through. This is universal.
2.  **The Non-Native Struggle:** This is what us non-native speakers have to struggle through. It doesn't matter if you got a perfect score in IELTS or TOEFL or if you are pretty proficient in English. As non-native speakers, especially if you're fresh off the boat, it can be uncomfortable being in a new environment talking to strangers.

Some of it has to do with the *substance* of your speech—namely what you talk about, what's on your mind, and what topics to choose. But other stuff has to do with the *style* of your speech. It has to do with slang, idioms, everyday expressions, and age-appropriate lingo. You don't want to be talking like a professor at an 18-year-old's sleepover; that’s a very specific demographic.

So, let's talk about the first segment.

### Segment 1: The Social Aspect

If I ever get invited to a party or get-together that I actually like, I personally do my best, and I suggest that you do your best too. All it comes down to is basic manners.

**1. Be Present**
Put your phone away. Actually act like you care about being there. Act like you're excited and excitable. Don't be "too cool for school." Put your goddamn phone away and stop taking selfies.

You kind of have to resist the urge to do what's comfortable. If it gets too uncomfortable—like nobody is giving you the time of day—just leave. But don't *be* there physically and not be there mentally. If the party is somewhat decent and people are trying to have a good time, just experiment a little bit. Let yourself feel excited. You don't have to be the goofiest, funniest guy in the room. You can just be yourself, but it starts with letting other people see you.

**2. Don't Be Scared to Exit**
This is a counter-intuitive mentality: don't be scared to exit a conversation. Whenever I go into a conversation, especially in a group setting where I'm not just talking to one person, I basically have a clock in my head that's ticking and signaling roughly when to leave.

If I'm just meeting you for the first time, I have about 30 seconds to one minute. It doesn't mean I won't come back, but in the initial interaction, I give myself a deadline to exit. This honestly brings out the best in me because when I'm talking to you and I know I can leave, I bring my best self forward. Whereas if I'm thinking, *"Oh my God, I'm stuck with this person,"* I have no incentive to actually get to know you.

**3. Put the Focus on Other People**
A lot of times when you feel awkward and self-conscious, it's all about yourself, right? But when you put the focus on other people—when you're curious about what they're about, what they do, what makes them interesting, and their life story (even if it's not really that interesting)—you change the dynamic.

When you put the focus on others, you adopt a **scavenger hunt mentality**. You're at the party for a reason. You have a quota in your head. You're not just there to chill; you actually want to get some information out of it.

First, it gives your brain something to focus on. Second, it takes your insecurities out of the equation. You're not thinking of yourself. You're not thinking, *"Oh, I should have said that,"* or *"I should have acted that way,"* or *"Am I cool?"* or *"Do I have a booger on my face?"* None of that. All these mentalities are stepping stones for you to actually communicate and say stuff of substance.

### Segment 2: All About the Language

The very first step is ensuring you pass a certain level of fluency. You can't be struggling with basic communication. If you're struggling to even come up with a sentence, or understanding what native speakers are trying to say, then it's not a small talk issue. That's when you come to me (just a little shameless plug).

Assuming you can communicate just fine, here is the plan:

**Step 1: Input and Output (The "Working Out" Analogy)**
You need language *input*. When you're speaking about something you feel passionate about, you're basically giving a monologue. In order to have a paragraph prepared in your head off the cuff, like I'm doing right now, you have to read up on the topic or watch videos first.

More importantly, you need *output*. I write a diary every day. Sometimes it's not even good, but it gets me going. It gets me used to the idea of putting thoughts, words, and ideas together. So when I'm speaking to a person, it's not the very first time I've come up with an original idea.

If you want to be eloquent, articulate, and have interesting ideas at a party, you have to start before the party—like two months before. It's a lifestyle. I feel like most people, myself included, have gotten used to going about life in autopilot mode where you don't feel anything, or you just think what everybody else thinks.

I want you to become a creator rather than just an audience member. Become the active participant, the active judge, critic, and curator of your life. Put ideas together. Try things out. Write essays, even just for yourself. Write your opinions down or record videos just for yourself.

The point is: **come to the party prepared with ideas.** And it's not a one-time thing. You don't want to do this just for a big party because it's not going to work like that. It's like working out. You don't want to work out only when you need to look hot in a brand new dress to impress a guy. You want to work out because it makes you healthy. Then, when you've maintained that lifestyle for months on end, if a guy spontaneously shows up at your doorstep, you won't feel unprepared.

If you're always ready, you won't *have* to get ready. If you're always ready for a social interaction, even with just one person, you won't have to scramble to find stuff to talk about. This applies to your Chinese social circle too.

**Step 2: Polish Your Style**
This is not the substance of your speech; this is the fluff. It's the bells and whistles. It's the embellishments—things like everyday expressions, slang, idioms, and age-appropriate lingo.

The way 18-year-olds and Gen Z talk varies wildly from the way 40-year-olds talk. Go on Amazon and look up books on American idioms, slang, and everyday expressions. There are so many—I can recommend a few—but Google is your best friend.

Also, check out TikTok comments, Reddit, YouTube... anything where young people are talking and writing. That's your best resource. You don't have to talk like that all the time or use slang in every sentence, but just knowing it gives you a sense of assurance. At least when other people mention it, you won't be caught off guard.

Focus 70% to 80% of your energy on the **substance** (writing, reading, forming opinions) and 20% to 30% on the **fluff** (style).

### Final Thoughts: Have an Adventurous Spirit

Okay, my camera battery just died so I'm recording the outro on my phone, but I basically wrapped up everything. I just have one more thing to add.

**Have an adventurous spirit.**

You can be shy and still want to have fun. You can be shy and still be curious. You can be shy and be a good listener. When the time comes and a good option presents itself for you to speak your piece, don't be so self-conscious that it stops you from having fun, even for a moment.

Know that you can leave anytime. Know that it doesn't have to be serious. Nobody is grading your conversations. Don't take everything so seriously. You don't have to give the answers they were looking for; you can make it your own.

For instance, if someone asks, *"Oh, what do you do for a living?"* sometimes I tell them the truth: "I'm an English teacher, I make videos online." But other times I'm just like, *"Oh, I'm a glorified unemployed individual,"* and we have a laugh. It depends on who you're talking to and the occasion, but most of the time the conversation doesn't have to be serious. If you can poke fun at yourself, you get closer to people a lot faster.

So yeah, this is my advice to you. Report back to me on how these tips may have helped you. I hope to hear some good news.

All right, ciao.
